This is a foundational template for Android app development centered around **Android Jetpack Compose**.

In this template, all app-specific logic resides within the `app` module, while common logic is included within `core` modules.

Given its nature as an Android project, the default package remains `app` and is not altered to match
the layer namespace during template generation. Instead, the namespace is utilized as the `applicationId`.
