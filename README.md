# About

This is a foundational template for Android app development centered around **Android Jetpack Compose**.

In this template, all app-specific logic resides within the `app` module, while common logic is included within `core` modules.

As this is an Android project, the default package remains `app` and is not altered to match
the layer namespace during template generation. Instead, the namespace is utilized as the `applicationId`.
This can be changed or made configurable with time.

In its current implementation, the template is based on the following pre-configured integrations:

- Jetpack Compose - https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose
- Jetpack Navigation - https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation
- Hilt - https://dagger.dev/hilt/
- Material Components 3 - https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/compose-material3

However, this selection can be modified and made customizable once any alternative solutions are integrated into the template.
