## Overview

Currently, there is no specific API designed for this component. The integration ensures the
utilization of a pre-configured OkHttp instance and initializes it appropriately during the
application initialization phase using `app.ui.component.image.CoiIImageLoaderInitializer`.

## Example

All examples are available on the official documentation page: [Coil Getting Started](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/getting_started/).
