## Overview

The library is pre-configured in the `app.di.datasource.ProvidesHttpSource` class.

**Chucker** will display a notification showing a summary of ongoing HTTP activity. Tapping on the notification launches the full **Chucker UI**.


## Important

For **release** builds the library will not intercept HTTP requests/responses, so no changes required from your side.
